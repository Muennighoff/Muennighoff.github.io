Hey! I'm a research engineer working on **large language models**. I did my bachelor's at [Peking University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peking_University) & have since been working in industry at [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/), [Aleph Alpha](https://www.aleph-alpha.com/). I'm always interested to hear about research opportunities (currently considering starting a PhD). I've worked in Chinese, English, Japanese, French & German, but I don't have enough parameters so I forgot much of the last two üòÖ

I'm interested in creating better, more general language models. To do so, I've had the chance to work with amazing collaborators on:

**(a) large language models:** Developing [data-constrained scaling laws](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.16264), building the largest open-source models ([BLOOMZ/mT0](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.01786) & [BLOOM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.05100)) & large code models ([SantaCoder](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.03988) & [StarCoder](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.06161))

**(b) language embeddings:** Built the largest embedding benchmark ([MTEB](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.07316)) & state-of-the-art retrieval models ([SGPT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.08904))

**(c) multimodal models:** Won 2nd/3300 in Meta's Hateful Memes Challenge ([Blog](https://ai.facebook.com/blog/hateful-memes-challenge-winners/), [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.07788))

I love this field & am very optimistic about the future of AI ‚ù§Ô∏è Outside of machine learning I love sports (üéæ, üèÉ, üèä) & value investing.

Feel free to reach out :)
