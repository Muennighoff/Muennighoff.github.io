I'm an AI research engineer working on **large language models**. I did my bachelor's at [Peking University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peking_University) & have since been in industry. I've worked in Chinese, English, Japanese, French & German, but I don't have enough parameters so I forgot much of the last two 😅

My research focuses on creating better and more general language models. To do so, I've had the chance to work with amazing collaborators on:

**(a) large language models:** Developing [data-constrained scaling laws](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.16264), building the largest open models ([BLOOMZ/mT0](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.01786) & [BLOOM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.05100)) & large code models ([OctoPack](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07124), [StarCoder](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.06161) & [SantaCoder](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.03988))

**(b) language embeddings:** Building the largest embedding benchmark ([MTEB](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.07316)) & state-of-the-art retrieval models ([SGPT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.08904))

**(c) multimodal models:** Won 2nd/3300 in Meta AI's Hateful Memes Challenge ([Blog](https://ai.facebook.com/blog/hateful-memes-challenge-winners/), [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.07788))

I love this field & am very optimistic about the future of AI ❤️ Apart from AI, I am very interested in health (🏊, 🎾, 🏃, 🌸).

Feel free to reach out :) I'm especially interested in hearing about possible research collaborations & PhD opportunities.
