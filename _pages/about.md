I research **large language models (LLMs)** at Contextual AI & starting in Sep. as a PhD student at Stanford. I did my Bachelor's at Peking University. I've worked in Chinese, English, Japanese, French & German, but I don't have enough parameters so I forgot much of the last two 😅

My research focuses on advancing LLM capabilities, where I've had the chance to work with amazing collaborators on:

**🧙🏻‍♂️ Scaling:** Scaling up LLMs is critical to improve them. I study how it works ([data-constrained scaling laws](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.16264)) & apply it to create open LLMs ([OLMo](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00838), [StarCoder](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.06161), [BLOOM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.05100)).

**🫡 Alignment/Instruction-following:** Models need to follow instructions to be truly useful. I study improving it in many settings, e.g. multilingualism ([BLOOMZ/mT0](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.01786)), coding ([OctoPack](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07124)), or embedding ([GRIT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09906)).

**🤔 Other:** I've also had the chance to work on the largest text embedding benchmark ([MTEB](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.07316)) & build multimodal models winning 2nd in Meta's Hateful Memes Challenge ([Blog](https://ai.facebook.com/blog/hateful-memes-challenge-winners/)).

I love this field & am very optimistic about the future of AI ❤️ Apart from AI, I am very interested in health (🏊, 🎾, 🏃, 🌸).

Feel free to reach out, I'm especially interested in possible research collaborations! I'm also happy to advise self-motivated people on a research project - I have many ideas that I think could be very impactful & we could work on together :)
